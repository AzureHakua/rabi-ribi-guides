## Reversed Hits

This is the damage done by a standard forward hammer combo.

Basic idea: the 2nd and 3rd hammer hits do (much) more damage backwards. Turn around during your combos to do more damage.

Terms:
* **Rev3**: Reverse only the 3rd hit. Easier to do.
* **Double Rev**: Reverse both the 2nd and 3rd hit. More difficult to do.

### Rev3
Turn around before the 3rd hit, turn back after the 3rd hit.

### Double Rev
Turn around before the 2nd hit, turn back after the 3rd hit. But it's not that simple. There are some things that can go wrong.

Correct double revs:

**Mistake 1:** If you stand too close to your target, you will end up doing a Rev3 instead. (look at the amount of damage done in the gif below)

**Mistake 2:** If you press the 3rd hammer hit too quickly, your 2nd and 3rd hits will combine into one hit (and do less damage overall. see the gif below).
* You need to wait until the 2nd hammer hit executes fully (i.e. does damage) before you press the hammer button the 3rd time.
* The first two hammers should be pressed quickly, the 3rd hammer must be delayed.
* Therefore, the input sequence is: `Hammer, face back, Hammer, wait, Hammer, face forward, mash Hammer`.

## Walking Hammers
Avoid doing walking hammers. Walking hammers do slightly more damage, but cause bosses to fly backward, making it difficult to trap them in a combo.

## Hammer Combo + Downdrill
After a hammer combo, it is generally better to jump+downdrill instead of doing an updrill.
If you have more SP, you can also do an updrill after the downdrill.

## Draining SP with Hammer Whiffs
SP regenerates more quickly after draining your SP completely. A good way to drain SP after a combo is to attack the air with the hammer. (hitting the boss would get you stuck on the boss's shield frames)

## Down/Up Drills through Shield Frames
Updrills and Downdrills can attack bosses through shield frames (when the boss is blinking). Don't do standard hammer combos through shield frames.

## Fire Orb
Upgraded Fire Orb does a ton of damage. A good way to drain SP for Fire Orb damage is to do 3 hit combo, updrill. Doing an updrill immediately after a combo drains a lot of SP at once.

## Airdash Level 1
Airdash does a decent amount of damage in boss fights. This combo only works with airdash level 1 as higher-level airdashes send you across the arena.

## Walldash Combo
This works with Airdash level 3 as well. You need to pin the boss against the wall before you can do this combo.
* The updrill at the start is used to push chocolate to the wall.
