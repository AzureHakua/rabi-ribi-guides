## Early whirlbonk

## Fast fairy bonks
If you do this, you don't need to regenerate an amulet charge at the save point.
* Extremely tight though. You need to whirlbonk at this exact timing to gain enough height to get up.

## Nieve backup strat
* Use this if the 6tile airjump fails.

## Dark Room 2

Method 1: Recommended

Method 2: Not recommended.
* This is extremely tight, not feasible RTA imo.

## Airdash item and Library room
* The 6tile airjump after the airdash pickup is easier than regular 6tile airjumps, because you can airjump -> airdash -> let go of jump and buffer airjump

## Library Jump 2
Safe buffered strat (keyboard only)
1. jump, hold right, then hold left, then quickdrop (so now right+left+down are held)
2. airdash under the wall, let go of down (continue to hold left+right)
3. buffer airjump from the airdash, then buffer another jump immediately after the airjump executes (continue to hold jump+left+right)
The moment you hit the left wall, you should automatically walljump off it and glide onto the ledge. (as long as you continue to hold jump+left+right)

## Fast movement to gold carrot
Note: jump over the savepoint to avoid the nieve cutscene.

## Wallkick to keke after gold carrot

## Keke Bunny
* Don't attack keke bunny at all. This way, her second attack should break the floor (most of the time). Her first attack is always fixed, you can't change that.

## Fast method for pink room
* Uses the same AJ->AD->AJ 6tile trick as the airdash item room.
* Airdash into the wall to end the airdash prematurely. This makes the strat a little more risky, but faster.

## Pit climb final jumps
* This method avoids all save points in the game. (so you never have to view the nieve cutscene)
